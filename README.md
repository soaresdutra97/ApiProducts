Authentication
```markdown

Atention: The API will create a User with USER role by default, to access protected endpoints as an ADMIN user, you should create
a new "Register" and go to the Database and change Role to 0 if you want an ADMIN user.

POST /auth/login - Login into the App returns a JWT Token, and you have to put it in "Authorize" section
to permit you make http requests. 
```

## Authentication
The API uses Spring Security for authentication control. The following roles are available:

```
USER -> Standard user role for logged-in users.
ADMIN -> Admin role for managing partners (registering new partners).
```

To access protected endpoints as an ADMIN user, you should create a new "Register" and go to the Database (With Dbeaver, for example) and change Role to 0 if you want a ADMIN user.

## Database
The project utilizes [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.
